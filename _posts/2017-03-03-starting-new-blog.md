G'Day Internet!

Started from today, Iâ€™m trying to born new blogging website that previously left abandoned.

Why left abandoned? Good question! but hard to say. I still donâ€™t know the exact reason, maybe just because Iâ€™m too lazy to do things ðŸ˜…. But, recently I realized that I feel something didnâ€™t work correctly, perhaps just because I need to share something that I thought bit complicated. 

Unfortunately, some social media I used still not able to do these things (e.g. sharing code, tutorial, raw graphic design). Twitter too short to share a *hello world* code, but Instagram is too good-looking to share a .zip file. I need something in-between a to be honest.

Well, I donâ€™t really know where the ships were going to go. But, the only thing I know isâ€¦ weâ€™re going to move forward, and write something better than yesterday, hope it works. :)



Sincerely,
Khakim
