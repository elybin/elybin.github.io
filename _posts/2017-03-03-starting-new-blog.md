G'Day Internet!

Started from today, I’m trying to born new blogging website that previously left abandoned.

Why left abandoned? Good question! but hard to say. I still don’t know the exact reason, maybe just because I’m too lazy to do things 😅. But, recently I realized that I feel something didn’t work correctly, perhaps just because I need to share something that I thought bit complicated. 

Unfortunately, some social media I used still not able to do these things (e.g. sharing code, tutorial, raw graphic design). Twitter too short to share a *hello world* code, but Instagram is too good-looking to share a .zip file. I need something in-between a to be honest.

Well, I don’t really know where the ships were going to go. But, the only thing I know is… we’re going to move forward, and write something better than yesterday, hope it works. :)



Sincerely,
Khakim
