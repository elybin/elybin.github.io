Have you heard of **Bitcoin**? Currently, Bitcoin is a leader of the cryptocurrency â€” the new kind of internet money made by pseudo-name [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) that has recently become mainstream. There's also a fraction of cryptocurrency called [**Bitcoin Cash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Cash), is a hard-fork of Bitcoin, which means like a new version of *Microsoft Word*, which generates documents that can no longer be opened via the older versions. So, it is still called Bitcoin? The answer is: Yes, but no.

Short story, I really curious about how it feels to use this currently "hype" payment method. But I still don't know what service or goods that I think worth to spent. Until I found some really cheap VPS (*Virtual private server*) recommendation that supported cryptocurrency as a payment method. My first attempt goes to [RackNerd](https://my.racknerd.com/aff.php?aff=2185), which I thought the cheapest VPS I ever know. It started with the price of $1.92/mo and $10.98/year for 1GB RAM, 15 GB Storage, and 2TB Bandwidth, It's extremely affordable. 

Then, I tried to do a comparison between Bitcoin Cash and PayPal which both methods are supported. Worth noting that, I used [Indodax](https://indodax.com/) to convert Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) into Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and it cost me about Rp3,000 for deposit fee and Rp847 for trade fee. After that, CoinPayments (*Cryptocurrency Payment Service Provider*) charge me about Rp3,875. So, in total it's about Rp4,603 for the transaction fee. Which I found myself jaw dropped! ðŸ˜² It's extremely cheap! To put in the perspective, PayPal would charge me about Rp12,682 just for PayPal itself. Excluding fee to convert IDR into USD (about Rp6,000) from the bank.

In conclusion, there is a huge probability that this disruptive technology going be mainstream and widely adopted worldwide, of course, it will revolutionize the world. Because of the transparency,  low-payment costs, and extremely fast calculation. It just takes about ~15mins to completely finish the transaction, and don't need to print more money and recalculate the current asset like the conventional one.  Plus, I love how cryptocurrency treats everyone as the same users, apart from nationality and location. Personally, I'm amazed at this technology, what a time to be alive!
