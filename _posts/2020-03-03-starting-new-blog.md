G'Day Internet!

started from today, i’m trying to born new ugly blogging website that previously left abandoned.

why left abandoned?

good question, boy! i still don’t know the exact reason, but maybe just because i’m too lazy to do things. but, recently i realized that i feel something didn’t work correctly, perhaps just because i need to share something that i thought bit complicated. 

unfortunately, some social media i used still not able to do these things (e.g. sharing code, tutorial, raw graphic design). twitter too short to share a hello world code, but instagram is too good-looking to share a .zip file. i need something in between a to be honest.
well, i don’t really know where the ships were going to go. 

but, the only thing i know is… we’re going to move forward, and write something better than yesterday, hope it works. :)



sincerely,

Khakim
