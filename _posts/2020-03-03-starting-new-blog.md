Good Day Internet!

Started from today, I’m trying to born new blogging website that previously left abandoned.

why left abandoned?

Good question boy! I still don’t know exact reason, but maybe just because I’m too lazy to do things. But, recently I realized that I feel something didn’t work properly, maybe just because I need to share something that I thought bit complicated. 

Unfortunately, some social media I used still not able to doing this things (eg. sharing code, tutorial, raw graphic design). Twitter too short to share a hello world code, but Instagram are too good-looking to share a .zip file. I need something in between a to be honest.
Well, I don’t really know where the ships going to go. 

But, the only thing I know is… we’re going to move forward, and write something better than yesterday, hoped it works.





Sincerely,
